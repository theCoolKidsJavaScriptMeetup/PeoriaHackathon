				        <p>Individuals or teams of 2-7 participants will come together to solve a local challenge. Participants will receive a Challenge Statement and access to relevant data sets. They will then utilize this data to create a website, app, or other tool that could improve the lives of people who live, work, and play in the Peoria area.</p>
				        <p>After the 10 hour hacking session, teams will demo their projects to a panel of judges who will decide which 2 teams created the best solution to the Challenge Statement. The first and runner-up team will receive cash prizes.</p>
